      <div>
        Thank you for using 4:20 ("App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we
        handle your data when you use our App to check when the next 4:20 occurs
        around the world.
      </div>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <div>
        Our App is designed to function entirely on your device. We do not
        collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The App only
        accesses:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>The current time on your device</li>
        <li>Your device’s time zone settings</li>
        <li>No other data is accessed, stored, or shared in any way.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <div>
        The time and time zone data from your device is used only to calculate
        and display when the next 4:20 will occur somewhere in the world.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>This information is not stored</li>
        <li>This information is not sent to any server</li>
        <li>This information is not shared with any third parties</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Local Access Only:</span> The App does not save any
          information to your device’s storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">No Remote Access:</span> We do not have access to
          your device, and no data is transmitted externally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Security:</span> Since no data is stored or
          transmitted, the only security measures applicable are those you
          maintain on your device.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <div>
        Our App does not use or integrate with any third-party services. All
        functionality runs directly on your device without external
        dependencies.
      </div>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <div>
        Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe
        a child has used the App inappropriately, please contact us.
      </div>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div>
        We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. When we do, we will:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Update the policy on this page</li>
        <li>Revise the Effective Date at the top</li>
      </ul>
      <div>We encourage you to check back periodically for any changes.</div>
